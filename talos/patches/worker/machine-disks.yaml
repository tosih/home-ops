# Talos System Disk Configuration
#
# NOTE: Talos manages system volumes (BOOT, META, STATE, EPHEMERAL) automatically.
# The EPHEMERAL partition grows to use all available space by default.
# Attempts to limit EPHEMERAL size via VolumeConfig are ignored by Talos.
#
# For Rook/Ceph storage:
# - Use hostPath mounts on the EPHEMERAL partition (/var/lib/rook)
# - Or add dedicated physical disks to worker nodes
# - RawVolumeConfig only works when there's unallocated space (minimal on single disk systems)
